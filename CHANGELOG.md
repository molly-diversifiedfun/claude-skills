# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill library. Newest first.

## 2026-06-29 — Operational infrastructure: 2 skills shipped

Closes the session-continuity gap. Also ships `TASKS.md` and `HANDOFF.md` to end 7 weeks of state reconstruction from `git log`.

**Claude Code Power User**
- `prompt-factory` — extracted from `ai-build-partner/references/` into a standalone skill; generates research-grade prompts pre-filled with your context when you need external knowledge (current pricing, tool comparisons, audience research, platform setup)
- `session-resume` — reconstruct working state at session start in under 60s; reads `HANDOFF.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `git log`; also handles `ai-build-partner` context via `.unstuck/context.md`

Total skill count: 25 → **27**.

## 2026-05-15 — Batches 3–5: 8 PRD'd skills shipped

Closes the final 8 "coming soon" entries. Each ships with full pipeline (research → PRD → SKILL.md → README).

**Learning & Research**
- `learn-anything` — active recall tutor that refuses to lecture; distractor-based diagnostics; 3-strike escape hatch
- `explain-like` — concept mapped onto a domain you already know; built on Gentner structure-mapping; refuses bad analogies
- `research-brief` — GRADE 4-rung confidence per claim; search-handles instead of citations; never fabricates sources
- `book-distiller` — argument-first thesis, not summary; three-tier confidence routing; refuses to fake distillations on books with thin training data

**Editing & Productivity**
- `precision-editor` — pick a level (flag / suggest / light / heavy) BEFORE Claude touches the text; mandatory "Wanted to change but didn't" log
- `meeting-distiller` — transcript → project-management artifact; the word "summary" is banned at the prompt level

**Career & Professional**
- `interview-coach` — 4 modes (JD analysis / question prep / mock with rubric scoring / negotiation); anti-sycophantic by design
- `career-experiment` — 3 testable experiments at 3 effort tiers; 14-day first-signal cap; refuses vague success signals

Total skill count: 18 → **25**.
